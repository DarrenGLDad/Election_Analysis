## Challenge Overivew

Create Lists, Dictionaries, Strings, Variables, as well as for-loops and decision (if) statements. In adddition, this required scripts, repetition and print statements to be written.

## Challenge Summary

- Ascertained the county with the largest voter turnout as well as each county's percentage of the total vote count.

This script can be used for any election to determine not only a winner but several other integral pieces of information to formulate future plans for the campaign trail; for instances, where one might want to focus the efforts.
